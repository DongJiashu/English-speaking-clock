# English-speaking-clock
This is my first python project after 2 month python course! It was finished in Oct 2024. 
It is a clock being able to present the real time and announce the time with human (my) speech. 
Some interesting features like 24/12 hours settings, reminders, other languages, manual time are included. 

To run the project, simply download all files and open juptyer notebook, make sure you have all the dependencies.
Overwrite your file path in line 379, that would be the only change you need to do!

Run the notebook, Extend the window to full screen, Play around! 
Check english, with reminder, manual time, 20 pm.
Other languages' audios are not released yet because of lack of consent. 
UI is not perfect as it's not the focus of this project. 

The English audios is only allowed to use for your research or for fun. No business/commertial usage is allowed without my consent. 

This is a group project, done together with another team member.
